                        <p><span class="stc-name">ShareTheCaregiving&#8482;, Inc.</span> (STCG) is a not-for-profit organization and is registered with New York State, Department of Law, Charities Bureau.</p>

                        <p>On July 1, 2008 <span class="stc-name">ShareTheCaregiving&#8482;, Inc.</span> put its 501c3 into hibernation in order to go under the fiscal umbrella (501c3) of the National Center for Civic Innovation (aka The Fund for the City of New York). NCCI provides us with needed fiscal and administrative management services so we can better focus on our mission.</p>

                        <p class="last"><span class="stc-name">ShareTheCaregiving&#8482;, Inc.</span>(STCG) is also widely referred to as <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span>(STC)</p>


                        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>

                        <blockquote>To improve the “quality of life” of anyone<br>
                        who needs support–and to reduce the stress,<br>
                        depression, isolation and economic hardship of their caregivers.</blockquote>

                        </div>


                        <h2>OUR FOCUS IS EDUCATION</h2>

                        <p>Caregiving will touch everyone at some point in life yet it often remains in the shadows of the public/media spotlight because it does not make for a picture that melts the heart but rather one to be avoided at all costs. Not so much because people are uncaring but rather frightened and uneducated.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes, friends disappear when illness strikes because they don’t know “what to do or what to say.”</p>

                        <p>And often the person needing support and their caregiver hide the fact and carry the entire burden alone rather than admit they could use help.</p>

                        <p>STC’s focus is on educating caregivers, patients and their concerned friends, neighbors, co-workers and acquaintances about the profound personal benefits to everyone involved through sharing the care.</p>

                        <p>Because we find that family caregivers often tend to be isolated and therefore less likely to reach out for help, we target professionals, and faith communities. They see caregivers and patients on a daily basis and are best situated to identify those who could benefit from a STC group. We also seek to reach working caregivers through corporations.</p>

                        <p>Sheila has combined her life experiences as a three-time caregiver, co-author speaker and trainer with her creative and advertising background skills to create the materials and programs the organization uses to communicate its message and carry out its mission.</p>

                        <p>Her unique perspective on caregiving comes from having been a solitary long distance caregiver for her widowed mother and then part of the group, for her friend, Susan Farrow, that pioneered the STC model, and again years later in a group for Co-author Cappy Capossela.</p>

                        <p>These group experiences as well as those of groups around the country, who have successfully used the STC model, have reinforced Sheila’s determination to make the public aware of the incredible benefits derived from this collaborative approach to caregiving.</p>

                        <p>It is her dream that people everywhere involved in making caregiving decisions will view the STC model as a viable and rewarding option.</p>

                                            <h4 class="title title-end">Graphic Designer</h4>

                                            <p>After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Fine Arts at York College, CUNY, Christie Taylor began her graphic arts career as a print production designer. Her assignments included editing newsletters and magazine layouts, catalogues and commercial ads. She moved into web design and created graphics and design templates for websites and email newsletters.</p>

                                            <p>Having always been enamored by the dynamics of story telling for television, Ms. Taylor designed a online magazine dedicated to one of her favorite television shows, “Moonlighting,” which starred Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd. Ms. Taylor independently published eleven print and online issues that ranged from 40 to 140 pages. The magazine was well received and credited as being the catalyst for ABC and Lionsgate’s decision to produce and distribute “Moonlighting” on DVD. From the success of the magazine, Ms. Taylor worked on several web design projects. She also focused a large part of her time to study television writing by attending workshops, writing spec and original scripts. She has also studied copy writing and improv comedy.</p>

                                            <p class="last">Ms. Taylor experienced the complex emotionally stressful life of being caregiver when her mother was diagnosed with the rare blood cancer Multiple Myeloma. Sadly in 2009 her mother lost her battle and in 2013 Christie’s aunt passed on from the same disease. This experience of loss drives Ms. Taylor’s interest to volunteer with Share The Care, to help increase awareness for caregivers who are in need of support. Ms. Taylor completed her original web series pilot entitled “F.P.I.: Film Private Eye”.

                                        <p>Claire Culbertson has been an enthusiastic supporter of STC since 2002 when she was employed at the University of Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center as an Outreach Specialist. For two years she coordinated a program to introduce the STC model to health professionals and faith communities in central and southern Wisconsin, and helped STC groups form for women with breast cancer.</p>

                                        <p>In 2003, when Sheila Warnock founded <span class="stc-name">ShareTheCaregiving&#8482;, Inc.</span>, Claire officially joined the movement as the very first Volunteer Outreach Director.  Her main focus was to develop ways to spread the word about the STC model to communities and healthcare providers in the Midwest.</p>

                                        <p>From 2003-2014, Claire worked to support family caregivers through the National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) at two of Wisconsin’s Area Agencies on Aging. The STC model served as a valuable resource and compliment to her efforts.</p>

                                        <p>In 2011 Claire was named the NFCSP Special Project Coordinator for the Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources (GWAAR), an Area Agency on Aging serving 70 Wisconsin counties. Claire led the first STC Stations pilot program and trained professionals to be Station Managers so they could provide information and support to family caregivers and friends who wanted to form a STC team. When she resigned in 2015, to relocate with her husband to Oregon, there were 15 STC Stations throughout the state.</p>

                                        <p>Building on those STC Stations, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services received a 3-year-grant from the Federal Administration for Community Living to develop additional Stations and training with a goal of using STC specifically to support people with dementia who are living alone. The Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources was awarded the contract to develop and implement the program in 2015.</p>

                                        <p class="last">Today, Claire continues with her passion by introducing STC in her new community–specifically with an ecumenical group serving multiple faith communities, and through Volunteers-in-Action–a program of the local Providence Hospital system.</p>

                                        <p>Kimi Morton Chun lives in Honolulu, Hawaii as a fitness trainer and manager at Egan Inoue’s Fit Body Bootcamp, an instructor at Happiness University, and a lifestyle blogger <a href="http://www.kimimorton.com">www.kimimorton.com</a> dedicated to “body and life optimization.” Kimi is a proud Share the Care volunteer and has helped many families over the years to set up Share the Care groups to provide quality of life, not just for the patient, but for the entire family.</p>

                                        <p>Kimi’s experience with <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> began in 2002, when her mother-in-law, local artist Peggy Chun, was diagnosed with ALS. In 2003, Peggy’s sister and best friend presented the <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> book to the family and soon after Peggy’s group “Peg’s Legs” was born. Kimi developed and managed this group of volunteers that grew to include over 100 participants over the 5 plus years of Peggy’s illness. Kimi served as a leader for “Peg’s Legs” while simultaneously running Peggy’s art business, and raising a family.</p>

                                        <p>Peggy captured the “spirit of aloha” in her paintings and thrived on sharing her love of the islands (and life!) with the world. Even through her six-year battle with ALS, Peggy continued, with the help of her Share The Care™ group, to live a full and creative life, inspiring those around her with her courage, passion, and sense of humor in the face of adversity. (See DVD and Q & A with Kimi under SHARE YOUR ADVICE on this website)</p>

                                        <p>Eileen has worked in the advertising industry for more than 25 years, first as a Producer of TV commercials for ad agencies McCann-Erickson and Doyle, Dane, Bernbach, and currently as a partner and Executive Producer for Mathew Brady Films in New York.</p>

                                        <p>She and her husband, director Mathew Brady, produce TV commercials for clients like M&M Mars, Smirnoff, Subway Foods, Hershey, Seven-Up and Jack-in-the-Box, specializing in up-close food photography.</p>

                                        <p>Eileen has served as a volunteer at Hutzel Hospital in Detroit, where she was responsible for reinstating their Pediatric Volunteer program. In New York City, she volunteered at Bellevue Hospital’s Pediatric Ward, working primarily with infants born addicted to drugs, and with HIV positive infants and toddlers. A great number of these children are the “boarder babies” — babies who live in the hospital because their parents are often incarcerated or unable to care for them because of problems like drug addiction or histories of abuse. These are the children who need to be loved, to be held and soothed and played with... things the otherwise caring staff does not have time for.</p>

                                        <p>When she is not filming commercials Eileen serves on the Advisory Council of the Double “H” Hole in the Woods Ranch, one of the Hole in the Wall Camps founded by Paul Newman. Their mission is to help advance the purpose of providing children living with a critical illness an outdoor Adirondack adventure. Her responsibilities involve anything from helping to heighten public awareness of the Ranch’s important mission to working in the stables and introducing the children to the baby animals.</p>

                                        <p class="last">Eileen was a part of the first <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> group, Susan’s “Funny Family”, with Sheila Warnock and Cappy Capossela. In 2002, when Cappy was diagnosed with a brain tumor, Eileen was a member of her group, lovingly named “Cappy’s Brain Trust”.</p>

                                        <p>Marc C. Kluender, PhD’s career as a clinical psychologist spans 40 years. He founded and directed two psychological service organizations – Developmental Dimensions Institute (DDI) and Psych Resources of California, Inc.</p>

                                        <p>He was Staff Psychologist and Clinical Coordinator for a county mental health child and adolescent program and on the teaching staff providing consultation to a Family Practice Medical Residency Program. His individual practice specialized in anxiety, depressive and dissociative disorders and he has worked extensively with men in mid-life crises facing these issues.</p>

                                        <p>Dr. Kluender was the President of both the Alameda County and the Stanislaus County Psychological Associations. At the state level, he served on the California Psychological Association’s Board of Directors for Division I: Clinical and Professional Psychology and as Chairperson on the Task Force on HMOs and IPAs.</p>

                                        <p>He was a founding member and served on the Board of Directors of the California Association of Professional Psychology (CAPP) and received an award honoring his service as a founder. As an adjunct professor for the University of San Francisco and for California State University – Stanislaus, he taught courses in Developmental Psychology and Advanced Counseling Theory.</p>

                                        <p>Dr. Kluender’s connections to Share The Care began in the early 1990s. He and his wife were close friends of STC’s co-author, Cappy Capossela, and his wife, Margot Dishner, was part of Cappy’s Share The Care group. His direct involvement with STC began with service on the Monterey County Advisory Council (MOCO-STC). A group of community leaders formed this advisory council to establish the <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> model throughout the county.</p>

                                        <p class="last">On a personal level, Dr. Kluender formed a STC group for his closest friend’s adult son who had a rare form of muscular dystrophy, Kennedy’s Disease. It was enlightening to see up close the power of “community” that is at the core of STC. His interest is to further develop the psychological structure found in the seven principles. He believes that these seven principles not only create personal growth in each caregiver, but reach out to create a more caring world.</p>

                        <p>Authors Sheila Warnock and the late Cappy Capossela were best friends long before they developed <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span>. For years, they worked together in advertising as a creative team developing print and television campaigns for both men and women’s fragrances. In January 2002, eight years after STC was first published, something unthinkable happened. Both Cappy and her Dad were diagnosed with malignant brain tumors. While her mother and brother organized the care of her father in their hometown, Sheila rushed to put together a STC meeting with 33 of Cappy’s friends in New York City – later dubbed “Cappy’s Brain Trust.”</p>

                        
                        <div class="img-left4">

                        <p>Things got increasingly stressful following Cappy’s surgery to have her tumor de-bulked. In the weeks that followed she was rendered totally helpless and lost her abilities to speak, write, walk, and even move without the help of her group, and wonderful live-in nurses’ aide.</p>
                        
                        <p>See <a href="#">YOUR STORIES</a>

                        <p>Out of desperation, the Brain Trust created a special approach to handling the most critical jobs. Besides our regular assignments, each person took on a “Specialist Captain” role that was never shared. (For example: a trusted friend became the “Financial Captain” whose special responsibility was to manage Cappy’s funds and pay her bills. Working this way assured that nothing important in Cappy’s life would fall through the cracks as her illness continued to advance at a frightening pace Ten months later and within 12 hours of each other, the Capossela family and the Brain Trust lost both Cappy and her Dad.</p>

                        <p>Sheila recalls telling Cappy that she was going to take STC and get it out there in a big way. After being a primary caregiver three times (and a free-floater for another friend with ALS.) it was pretty clear that STC was to be Sheila’s life’s mission.</p>

                        <p>In 2003, she started the paperwork and by the next summer we had our 501c3 for ShareTheCaregiving and the rest is history.</p>

                        <img src="img/who-we-are-photos/Sukie-Miller.png" class="img-responsive img-left5">

                        <p>March 15, 1988 will forever be etched into my memory. It was that cold, windy night when the seed, later to bloom into a comprehensive caregiving model, was planted at an emergency meeting for a friend in the office of Dr. Sukie Miller.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Miller had strongly urged her patient, Susan Farrow, to reach out past her emotional comfort zone and ask her friends for help. Susan was a divorced, working mom with two teens and a painful bone cancer. To make matters worse she had no family nearby. However, by bringing what was a diverse bunch of friends together for some honest dialogue, we were able to plunge into action the very next morning.</p>

                        <p>We owe a huge debt to the insight, wisdom, and brilliance of Dr. Miller who truly understood the power of “group.” The 12 of us who attended that meeting went on to prove her right by supporting our friend in every way imaginable until she died nearly four years later. And we managed it without any one getting stuck doing too much. And best of all, we were bonded forever by this challenging yet significant life experience that resulted in us becoming widely known as “Susan’s Funny Family.”</p>
                        
                        <p>Later, Dr. Miller was the chief cheerleader when Cappy Capossela and I decided to document our systems into a handbook that others could follow to create a “caregiving family” of their own. Dr. Miller offered her guidance and gifted us with the eloquent FORWARD to <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span>, first published in 1995.</p>
                        
                        <p>Then, out of the blue, in early 2002 Cappy was stricken with a brain tumor and needed her own <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> group. Following Cappy’s death later that year, Dr. Miller again provided her enormous enthusiasm and encouragement for my decision to make <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> more widely known by founding our organization. And, as a member of our Board of Advisors for the last 10 years, she was always generous with her suggestions.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Sukie Miller was a profound influence in my life. I think it was her fearless and optimistic outlook that will be most treasured by me and surely by so many others in different parts of the world whose lives she touched. We will all miss this vivacious, and extraordinary woman with so many far-reaching legacies.</p>
