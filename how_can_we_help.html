                        <p>The STC model came into being through the personal experiences of the authors and 10 other women who came together to help care for a mutual friend. They worked together for nearly four years developing a unique system of caregiving as well as deep friendships that last to this day.</p> 

                        <p>The book was written so others could easily create their own “caregiving family.” Click here to read <a href="#">How STC Was Born</a></p> 

                        <p class="last">Hundreds of thousands of people around the world have used STC successfully and reported it to be a truly “life changing” experience.</p>

                        <p>No matter what the circumstance – STC can make a difference. The model supports, not just the care recipient, but also the primary caregiver as well as their entire family.</p> 

                        <p>And if the person needing support has no family nearby their STC group becomes their “family.”</p> 

                        <p>Bringing everyone together for a first group meeting is a job for two committed friends who will work with the caregiver and care recipient to figure out who to invite and what kind of help will be needed. STC provides guidance for them every step of the way.</p>

                        <p>STC supports the elderly in need of assistance so they can avoid isolation and depression while they age in place.</p>

                        <p>Groups have provided extra loving care for quadruplets, triplets, preemies, or to support moms with little children through a difficult pregnancy. They have sustained widow(ers) with small children, as well as a grandparents raising grandkids.</p> 

                        <p>For a working caregiver STC can provide peace of mind. Knowing that their loved one has home support, or someone checking on them and available to provide assistance in the case of an emergency.</p>

                        <p class="last">The STC model works for any issue that requires teamwork. Just use your imagination.</p>

                        <p>As described in the video interview, the STC model came into being through the personal experiences of the authors and 10 other women who wanted to “be there” for their mutual friend–a divorced working mom with two teens and a diagnosis of a rare cancer. While they cared for her over a period of nearly four years, they developed a unique system of caregiving as well as deep friendships that last to this day.  (Click here to read <a href="#">How STC Was Born</a>)</p>
                        
                        <p class="last">Hundreds of thousands of people around the world have used STC successfully and reported it to be a “life changing” experience.</p>
                        
                        <h2>First Step</h2>

                        <p>Acceptance: The first step is agreeing to allow others to help. One cannot take this step for granted.  It is an emotional decision that may require a bit of time and patience to reach.  However, if there is a crisis, there may not be the luxury of time.  Having a plan like STC is critical.</p>

                        <p class="last">Often we see caregivers and/or care recipients who are reluctant or resistant to accepting support even though it makes a lot of sense. It may help the care recipient to realize that their group will most certainly gain something personally from the experience.</p>

                            <h2>ANOTHER GROUP IS FORMED</h2>
                            <p>Susan died on September 14, 1991. Six months later, we got a phone call from a woman who had been a friend of Susan’s. Her name was Francine, and she had been suffering from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma for many years. She had met Susan at Cancer Care, a support group for patients, and they stayed in touch while Francine’s cancer went into remission and Susan’s grew worse. Susan often spoke of her Funny Family to Francine. After Susan died, Francine’s cancer reappeared and she was told she needed to have several courses of chemotherapy followed by a bone marrow transplant, a procedure that would leave her in a weak and vulnerable state for most of a year. Her aging parents and her sixteen-year-old daughter had been her only caregivers, and she was worried that coping with this dangerous and difficult treatment would be too much for them.</p>

                            <p>Francine described what she was about to go through, explained that she had a lot of friends who were trying to help but didn’t know how, and then in a timid voice asked if we thought she might need a Funny Family.</p>

                            <p>Our first reaction was to say, “Great,” Our second was, “Maybe Dr. Miller can lead it.” But Francine wasn’t into therapy and neither were most of her friends, and she wasn’t comfortable with that idea. She wanted us to lead the meeting. The prospect of leading the meeting without Dr. Miller was daunting. Even though Cappy and I had both been in hundreds of business meetings, this was different. This involved people’s lives. We knew that if we did it well we could actually help change the course of the next year for Francine and her friends.</p>

                            <p>We went to see Dr. Miller and told her we didn’t know if we could do this meeting without her. She said that indeed we could — and even do it better than she because we had lived through it. She instructed us to gather the members of Susan’s group and Francine and her friends and simply do a set of sharing exercises. We would share who we were and how we had come to know Susan; they would share who they were and how they knew Francine. We would share what we got out of being in Susan’s group; they would share what they hoped to get out of being in Francine’s group. We would not position ourselves as experts but merely give them the information, systems and forms we had developed over the course of three and a half years of taking care of Susan. We did not have to have all the answers, she said. All we had to do was share from the heart and keep the meeting on track.</p>

                            <p>We asked Francine to make a list of her friends and acquaintances who might want to help, and then sat down and tried to remember what had been the most important things in our (first) meeting with Dr. Miller and what had made a difference. In preparing for the meeting, we were surprised at the wealth of experience and information we had to pass on.</p>

                            <p>We consulted with Dr. Miller, planned the evening carefully, and divided it into two parts. In part one we would do the exercises we had done with Dr. Miller, and in part two we would pass along the practical worksheets we had developed.</p>

                            <p>When we called the members of Susan’s group, having not spoken to many of them for months, we were an immediate family. All twelve original members wanted to participate. Francine called to say fourteen of her friends were coming. The night of the meeting came. We had exercises to do and forms to give out. We had sandwiches, soft drinks, and cookies to have during a break. We had name tags for everyone.</p>

                            <p>The room was full of confusion as well as love and an intense desire to help. Francine was very nervous. Her friends were apprehensive. We were apprehensive. But the minute we began to share who we were and what we had done, the atmosphere in the room changed. We shared our experiences and memories, and realized that along with the difficulties and the pain, there had also been laughter, profound insights and miracles.</p>

                            <p>As Francine’s friends talked, it was very moving to see how much they cared for her, how much they wanted to help. There was a lot of warmth, laughter, and many tears as Francine talked about her illness, what she needed, how difficult it was for her to ask for help. We passed out the forms we had developed and explained the systems we had inaugurated. We watched in amazement as her friends began to see what was needed, to move themselves into commitment, to plan the practical steps they needed to take, and to bond together as a group.</p>

                            <p class="last">We will never forget the special power of that evening as a group of well-meaning but frightened, unsure people became Francine’s Funny Family right before our eyes! Here are some of the things her friends had to say:</p>

                            <blockquote>“I felt many things at that meeting. Sadness about Francine’s illness, the realization of what could happen in the future, pride in seeing my ‘sisters’ giving unconditionally, and the feeling that Francine felt privileged and felt our love.”<span class="strong">&nbsp;&nbsp;(l.N.)</span></blockquote>

                            <blockquote>“It was an incredible experience and I felt very lucky to be there. It was all I could talk about for weeks.” <span class="strong">&nbsp;&nbsp;(K.T.)</span></blockquote>

                            <blockquote>“It felt very spiritual because of all the love in the room. I have never felt anything like that before. I remember thinking that Francine has given us such a gift of sharing and how lucky I was to be chosen.” <span class="strong">&nbsp;&nbsp;(B.B.)</span></blockquote>

                            <blockquote>“I recall the organization and effort that went into the meeting. The dedication and commitment of Susan’s Funny Family. The fact that Susan had no relatives nearby. How collectively everyone was able to assist Susan and the honesty and ‘nondenial’ of Susan’s disease.” <span class="strong">&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.R.)</span></blockquote>

                            <p>The next morning, we realized that something unique had happened. We had found a way to share the burden of coping with serious illness, a way to take care of the caregiver. We realized how helpful it would have been if everything we had learned had been written down, and we resolved to document our caregiving system in a book. As we began to work on it, we realized that we were uniquely suited to the task. One of us had never been a caregiver and had been scared to death, and the other had nearly burnt out being a caregiver. Between us, we covered the two categories of caregivers struggling with serious illness today.</p>

                            <p class="last">Since that first meeting we have started many other caregiver groups, refining the meeting but basically following the same format. Each time, no matter who is in the group, no matter how much fear or resistance there is, no matter whether the person has been sick for a long time or has just found out about the illness, we have been moved by the goodness of people, by the deep desire to help and the longing to be part of something meaningful.</p>

                            <h3>This Book Is For You If...</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record"></span><p>You’ve never been a caregiver and someone with a serious, complex, demanding illness turns to you for help. You love them, want to be there for them, but you are afraid.</p></li>

                                <li class="last"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record"></span><p>You’re already taking care of someone who is ill and your own life is beginning to fall apart; you’re tired and burnt out and there doesn’t seem to be anyone else to help.</p></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="last">Now you don’t have to do it all alone. No matter how scared you are no matter how sick they are, whether you’ve been a “joiner” or led a meeting, with the help of this book you can create a group to <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;&nbsp;(STC)</span>. You can make caregiving a less stressful, healing, and meaningful experience for everyone. You can take total care of the person you love—and take care of yourself too.</p>

                            <h2>YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE A PROFESSIONAL</h2>
                            <p>You don’t have to be a therapist, nurse, or specialist to do this. It requires no professional training, but it uses all the skills you already have. It doesn’t cost anything, yet it could save weeks, months, even years of your life.</p>

                            <p>When Dr. Miller first asked Susan to invite her friends to a meeting Susan said there were only one of two people who would come. But Dr. Miller persisted until finally Susan came up with eighteen names. Twelve of us came. We were from different pockets of Susan’s life... from her office, from PTA meetings, from the summer house we shared. Some of us were old friends, some casual acquaintances. Most of us were complete strangers to each other.</p>

                            <p>We were in our thirties, forties and fifties. We were single, married, gay, straight, divorced, with children and without, one of us a grandmother. We had a wide variety of occupations. Some of us were highly successful, other struggling and unemployed. Among the people who came to the meeting were an actress, an advertising executive, a housewife, a hairdresser, a corporate executive and a secretary.</p>

                            <p>We lived as close as upstairs and as far away as the next state. Later, the group expanded to include Susan’s cousin, a sister of one of the members (who was a nurse), a voice teacher and a jazz pianist.</p>

                            <p>Although we were a competent, intelligent group, one of us had ever dealt with a terminally ill person for any extended period, none of us had any special training (except the nurse, who said being in the group gave her a whole new perspective on caregiving), and none of us had ever coped with the dying and death of a young woman who was a friend.</p>

                            <p>When we started, we knew very little about disease, doctors, hospitals, and nothing of the intense needs of the chronically ill people. But we stayed together for three and a half years. During that time, several members were added to the group, only one person dropped out, and no one experienced “burnout.”</p>

                            <p class="last">Listen to some of the people who were apprehensive about being in a caregiver family and did it anyway:</p>

                            <blockquote>“I just had such a need to do something for Lois. Whatever that was going to be, I had no idea. I needed to be part of her life and to help her in any way possible. I also wanted a better understanding of what she was to go through so that it could possibly alleviate some of my own terror concerning cancer. She was so strong–I needed to witness her strength. After being part of her (group), I realized how strong she was but also how strong I could be. I learned about choosing life from her and the trials an individual’s body must sometimes endue. My own priorities in life are now being re-examined.” <span class="strong">&nbsp;&nbsp;(W.F.)</span></blockquote>

                            <blockquote class="last">When Susan asked me to come to the first meeting, I felt apprehensive. I didn’t know most of the people coming. Was I getting involved in something uncomfortable, overwhelming, and possibly bigger than I wanted to deal with or commit to? Afterwards, I was glad I had been there, to be part of a vital group of women, an interesting, colorful, diverse group who would touch each other’s lives by helping a friend. <span class="strong">&nbsp;&nbsp;(L.T.)</span></blockquote>

                            <H2>THEY BELIEVE NO ONE CAN HELP</H2>

                            <p>Most seriously ill people believe no one can do anything to help, and it’s not surprising. They’ve been given horrendous diagnoses, been wheeled under huge frightening machines, and been confronted by a confusing set of options for treatments and drugs by a high tech, overburdened medical establishment that can be impersonal and cold. They’ve had doctors tell them that even they may not be able to help. They feel suddenly alone, different from everyone else. When what they’re facing is so huge, so catastrohphic, they can’t imagine it could help just to have someone to talk to, someone to go to a doctor with them, someone to hold their hand. Maybe they were never very well taken care of when they were young, so they don’t believe anyone can take care of them.</p>

                            <H2>THEY FEAR LOSING CONTROL</H2>

                            <p>Another reason they may not want help is the fear of losing control. Maybe they’ve survived other tragedies by retaining control. Maybe they’ve never confronted the fact that one day we will all lose control. In our fast-paced, chaotic, demanding world, most of us have spent years trying to gain control over our lives. We build fences and fortresses, put in alarm systems, and amass fortunes to protect ourselves. We live in a culture that tries to control the climate with air conditioning; the sun with SPF; aging with diets, vitamins and cosmetic surgery; the mind with medication; the future with astrologers; the personality with drugs. To be suddenly told we have a fatal disease and must immediately have surgery and radiation or we will die, to confront the random mystery of cancer or AIDS or Alzheimer’s is at odds with everything we have been told, everything we would like to believe.</p>

                            <p>Furthermore, the idea that we can no longer take care of ourselves brings up our deepest fears and our deepest wounds. We all want to take care of ourselves. From our first step to our first bicycle to our first job, we are proud of being able to support ourselves, to contribute, to be part of things. Suddenly we feel we may no longer be useful or needed.</p>

                            <p class="last">Asking for help means admitting how sick we are, and people with a serious illness have so many doctor appointments, so many trips to the hospital, so many crises, that they would have to ask and ask and ask. Every time they ask they feel more helpless, more out of control. Every time they ask, they feel they are imposing on their friends and driving them away.</p>

                            <h2>THEY FEAR LOSING THEIR PRIVACY</h2>

                            <p class="last">There are other fears. Most of us value our privacy and we fear that if we let a group into our lives, we will lose it. We won’t have our space. They will find out our secrets. Many people are uncomfortable in groups, preferring one-one-one situations. Usually, people who are ill have come to rely heavily on one or two people and, being obsessed with their own tragedy (understandably), have no idea what a burden they have become. So the idea of a whole group coming into their life, their home, even with the best intentions, may be viewed by the sick person as loss of that one special caregiver. They may feel that the group would bond together, leaving them out, or even be against them.</p>

                            <p class="last">During the years that Susan’s Group was in operation, certain issues came up again and again. In dealing with these issues, we discovered there were some guiding principles that seemed to hold all of us together through the good times and the tough times. They were somehow keys to our ability to work together and they proved themselves over and over. We call them The Seven Principles, and as you prepare to take part in a caregiver group we urge you to keep these points in mind. <a href="#">Click here to download them as a PDF.</a></p>

                            <h2>FINDING THE PEOPLE WHO CARE</h2>

                            <p>The following is a list that may help people who are ill find the people for their unique caregiver group. If you go through the list with them, you will find that there are many who care. People you never heard of. People you never expected. People who feel just like you do. They want to help but don’t know how. Even if there are items on the list that do not apply to your friend, it will surely spark some additional ideas.</p>

                            <p class="last">Encourage both men and women, young and old, close friends and casual acquaintances, people who have been caregivers and people who haven’t, people who want to do a lot, people who can do only a little. The more different backgrounds and abilities you have in the group, the more you’ll be able to help. There are enough jobs in every caregiver group so that every man, woman, teen and child can find a suitable job.</p>

                        <p>You know several people in your community who could use a <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) group. Several of their friends are ready to get things organized. However, the person in need of the care seems reluctant to have their caregiver approach others to participate. How can they be assured that this model will work without pushing people away? What can everyone do to get some much-needed relief for the caregiver?</p>
                        
                        <p>Working together in little groups within a larger group, people feel more encouraged and less alone in their need for outside support.</p>
                        
                        <p>Following background stories and examples of what groups are capable of doing we walk everyone through each of the steps needed to organize and maintain their first STC meeting.  Lots of Q & A and sharing.</p>
                        
                        <p>If a care recipient has no family caregiver–this is a wonderful way for two friends to start a “caregiving family” to support them.</p>
                        
                        <p>Following this workshop each should leave with plan of action and a sense of confidence and enthusiasm about accepting help.</p>
                        
                        <p>This workshop is between 3 - 3.5 hours (depending on number of people.) There is minimum of 30 people.</p>
                        
                        <p class="last ">Materials: Each participant receives a copy of the STC guidebook and a special workbook that includes 23 STC forms, handouts and suggestions.</p>

                        <h2 class="subtitle">(How STC was born)</h2>

                        <p>The story behind <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> began on March 15th, 1988, when twelve women, including the authors, got a call to come to a meeting to try and find a way to help their friend Susan cope with her worsening cancer. When Cappy and Sheila arrived that night they had two very different viewpoints:</p>
    
                        
                        <div class="susanf-img1">
                            <img src="img/caregivers-photos/susan_farrow-232x300.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                            <figcaption>Susan Farrow</figcaption>
                        </div>
                       

                        <blockquote>“I was terrified. I knew Susan had had a bout with cancer but she told me they ‘got it all’ and I wanted to believe it as much as she did. Susan was a divorced, working mother of two girls. She couldn’t be really sick. She was strong and successful and my peer. I had never grappled with sickness, death or dying, mine or anyone else’s. I had never taken care of anyone and I didn’t know how.” <span class="strong">&nbsp;&nbsp;~CAPPY</span></blockquote>
                        
                        <blockquote>I was relieved. Being Susan’s best friend, I had been there from the beginning... through the surgeries, hospital stays, treatments and recuperations.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>They sat in the first meeting with Susan’s friends, neighbors and co-workers (mostly strangers to each other) they never dreamed where it would lead them. Simultaneously, I was the sole caregiver of my elderly mother and I had just put her in a nursing home as I was no longer able to give her the care she needed. Not only was I wracked with guilt I was also exhausted beyond belief. My work suffered and my personal life was nonexistent.” <span class="strong">&nbsp;&nbsp;~ SHEILA</span></blockquote>
                        
                        <div class="susan-funny-fam">
                            <img src="img/caregivers-photos/susans_funny_family-w270.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                            <figcaption>Susan’s Funny Family</figcaption>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Over the next three and a half years this group stayed together and took total care of her. They cooked, shopped and did errands. They checked her in and out of hospitals, took her to doctor’s appointments and kept track of her medications. They laughed and cried with her and even organized her daughter’s wedding six months before she died. They became known as “Susan’s Funny Family.”</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>It might have ended there, but it didn’t. Six months later, they helped organize another group for Francine, a friend of Susan’s, who also had cancer. Francine’s group went on to be in operation for even longer than Susan’s and raised over $100,000 for her medical treatments over the course of her illness.</p>

                        <p>The power and impact of seeing another group of strangers become “Francine’s Funny Family” inspired the originators of this method to document their caregiving system in a book called <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span>.</p>
                        
                        <div class="francine-img">
                            <img src="img/caregivers-photos/francine_cina-216x300.jpg">

                        </div>
                        

                        <blockquote>“As we talk to the people who are using our book and to the people who have been helped by it, we still can’t believe what we started.” say Cappy and Sheila. “The Funny Family” experience has taught us a great deal about love and compassion and connected us to the larger human family in unexpected ways. The book is a practical guide. The stories behind it and around it are an inspiration.”</blockquote>
                        
                        <p>In the early years following the release of <span class="italic">Share The Care</span>, in December 1995, it quickly became the roadmap used by caregiver groups all over the country and adopted for programs by universities, disease specific organizations, faith communities and community groups.</p>

                        <p>STC was the subject of articles by: The Washington Post, Good Housekeeping, Redbook and Modern Maturity. Sheila and Cappy were thrilled to be invited to write a piece for the website for Bill Moyer’s “On Our Own Terms” TV special. The authors were interviewed on Orlando’s “America’s Health” channel and the “Home and Family” channel in Los Angeles. (See THE MEDIA)</p>

                        <h1>Caregiver FAQ</h1>
                        
                        <h3>Is <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> a support group?</h3>
                        <p>No. STC is a group caregiving model that allows people (friends, neighbors, co-workers and acquaintances to organize into a “caregiving family” to help someone they know in need of help. The group’s efforts are meant not only to help the care recipient but also the family caregiver and the rest of the family. And if someone has no family nearby, the group forms to become their “family.”</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why do we need a group?  Why not just hire a nurse’s aide?</h3>
                        <p>A STC group does not take the place of a professional caregiver, however, not everyone can afford to hire a full time aide. A STC group AND a nurse’s aide can all part of the same team. Friends have a head start as they know the care recipient (and their family) and can fill many needs that the professional is not legally allowed to do. For example: fundraising, research, taking care of the kids or pets, and keeping the recipient’s creative projects going or just hanging out.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How does a <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> group begin?</h3>
                        <p>A group might start at the suggestion of a friend, neighbor, co-worker or through someone who has experienced being in a STC group. Sometimes a family caregiver finds STC on the internet and decides it’s a good solution for their loved one’s circumstance. Even the person needing the support may discover the model and tell their friends “this is how you can help me.”</p>
                        
                        <p>And very often a health professional or the clergy might introduce this option to a family they know who is struggling with overwhelming caregiving responsibilities.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Do I have to be a professional to start a <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> group?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely not. With step-by-step directions, two people can organize the first meeting. They might be friends, neighbors, or co-workers. They will work with the care recipient/family to create a list of whom to invite and to figure out what kind of help will be needed. Chapters 2-9 in the STC book are written to them and explain in detail the STC systems and forms. The entire meeting is scripted. Thousands have done this meeting successfully and come away feeling focused, committed and energized.</p>

                        <h3>Did you just “make-up” this caregiving model?</h3>
                        <p>Actually it came out of the real-life experiences of 12 people (who didn’t know each other) who joined forces to support a mutual friend when she reached a crisis during her battle with terminal cancer. The STC manual covers not only how to organize a group but also how to keep it going. By sharing working as a tight knit team and sharing the responsibilities, they can maintain their efforts over long periods of time. The friendships that evolve during the experience are a special benefit.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why can’t you just send us someone to start a STC group?</h3>
                        <p>We believe in empowering people to start and maintain their own STC group.</p>

                        <p>Our philosophy is like the saying: “give a man a fish and he will eat for a day; teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime.” The STC book is your guide. Everything is explained in great detail and the systems are very logical and simple. Thousands of people have created STC “caregiving families” all across the US and in other countries.</p>

                        <p>We do provide online and telephone support to anyone who needs it.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Is STC only for cancer patients or people who are at end of life?</h3>
                        <p>Not at all. STC groups have make a profound difference for people with every imaginable illness (temporary, long term to terminal) as well as for people with disabilities. Groups can do much during the recuperation process after an accident, major surgery, or combat. They are also a wonderful way to support the elderly who need some assistance to remain safely in their home.  It benefits women with small children who are undergoing a difficult pregnancy, and help in the case of multiple births, or preemies. Widow(ers) have also benefited from a group especially when they have small children, as have grandparents raising grandkids on their own.</p>
                        
                        <h3>What do <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> groups do?</h3>
                        <p> They can do just about anything they set their mind to do…from everyday support (cooking, shopping, cleaning and going to doctor’s appointments) to fundraising, or keeping a small business running. A group can make it possible for a caregiver to keep working and bringing in a salary. They can accompany a care recipient out of the country/state for alternative treatments, and make it possible for patients to pursue their dreams–writing a book, painting, creating a labyrinth or garden, building a house, writing a musical.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How many people do you need for a <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> Group?</h3>
                        <p>Groups have been as small as 6 to over 100 people. They usually average about 20-40 members yet older adults prefer a much smaller group. Even if you have a small number to start, get going and plan to grow the team as you work.</p>

                        <p>8 people giving 3 hours a week can mean 24 hours of support to start.</p>
                        
                        <h3>What if I can’t help out every week?</h3>
                        <p>The good news is you can still make a difference by taking on the role of a “free-floater” or someone who can only help occasionally or in times of an emergency when someone is needed. All kinds of help is welcome.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How can I tell a friend about <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> – they live in another state?</h3>
                        <p>Probably the best way to introduce them to the STC model is to send them to our comprehensive website so they can explore and learn about how STC works. We also provide email and telephone support so they can contact us with any questions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Are <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> groups made up of only women?</h3>
                        <p>Not at all. Increasingly more and more men are caregivers and very good ones at that. Being in a STC group means offering the help one feels comfortable giving. There are certain jobs that men may feel more suited to do. We know of groups with men who have taken on the role of getting their “buddy” (with ALS) up, shaved and dressed for the day and then returning in the evenings to get him showered and ready for bed. That’s just one example.</p>
                        
                        <h3>What makes <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> groups different from volunteer groups?</h3>
                        <p>The main difference in STC groups and volunteers is that they already have a relationship with person they are caring for. Being a friend, sometimes, means that they will go above and beyond the call of duty to make something happen.</p>

                        <p>Though volunteers often develop close friendships with their care recipient they don’t start that way.</p>
                        
                        <h3>What’s the goal of <span class="italic">ShareTheCaregiving</span>?</h3>
                        <p>Our mission is to improve the quality of life of anyone who needs support–and to reduce the stress, depression, isolation and economic hardship of their caregivers. We believe that as our aging population continues to grow and more people need care, one way we can make a difference is to be part of a caregiving group. Being part of a STC group is a wonderful way to prepare more people to be caregivers.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How can I help <span class="italic">ShareTheCaregiving</span> with its mission?</h3>
                        <p>There are many ways you can help. Making a donation will help cover the cost of maintaining the organization so we can keep working to get the word out. This includes covering the costs of educational materials, upkeep of our website, and new projects that are being developed to specifically assist more caregivers, health professionals, faith communities and working caregivers.</p>
                        
                        <p>Please tell us about your group experiences and feel free to offer your suggestions. We welcome you stories and photos to inspire others to create their own STC groups. Tell people you know in need of caregiving support that this model is a rewarding option for their consideration.</p>

                        <blockquote>I think the (STC) book was the best piece of information we received in all our searching. It is the greatest and I recommend it to everyone who asks about our situation. I wish that all hospitals could hand it out when they give you a diagnosis for ALS. I wish you could get a grant to have it placed in every hospital waiting room and doctor’s office. Everyone knows someone who could benefit from reading it.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>The process used to set up the opening STC gathering was very loving, embracing, energizing and affirming – I think I can say we all felt that way... I was so humbled and gratified to hear of the ways I had impacted on others so much that they were willing to help me and my family as my care needs increase.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>I also found comfort in hearing how some thought this could also benefit them in their lives right now – as part of the facilitated process that went very well. I felt the circle concept of giving and receiving – which I am most comfortable with.</blockquote>

The program allowed me to spend more quality time with Kevin. I knew my time with him was limited, and I didn’t want to waste it going grocery shopping or running to the cleaners. I wanted to be with him as much as possible.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>While a caregiver to Kevin, I was also the mother of a young child. I often felt torn between caring for Kevin and our daughter Alina. I made the decision to ask our <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> group to help with Alina’s extracurricular activities. Volunteers came through, and their help brought me great joy.”</blockquote>

She was unable to talk very much as, for the first time since she told me of her diagnosis, she was emotional. It was seeing so many friends who want to help and she couldn’t say much, which is not typical! I gave her other opportunities later on.</blockquote>

I spend more time with positive influences, try to enjoy life more and don’t get as upset with things that in the past would have greatly upset me.

                            <h2><span class="stc-name">SHARE THE CARE&#8482;</span></h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>With the suspension of many government programs, and hospitals working to cut readmissions, the burden on family caregivers is increasing beyond their already stretched limits.</p>

                        <p>The health professionals cannot do or be everything for their patients and caregivers. We believe that the <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) model offers one of the most cost effective and rewarding ways to help avert the caregiving crisis.</p>

                        <p>City, county, state, and national health professionals, non-profit and disease specific organizations, hospices, and hospitals, can help the more than 65 million struggling caregivers in the US cope by introducing solutions that empower people to take control of their own caregiving needs.</p>

                        <p>Many, many more caregivers will be needed by 2030 when the Boomer population doubles to 71 million. And 25 million people are projected to develop dementia by 2050 unless a cure is found.</p>

                        <p>Yet the number of health professionals is on the decline and there is a dwindling number of younger people who might take on the role of caregiver in the future.</p>

                        <p>This is not just a concern in the US and Canada... it is a significant and troubling issue globally.</p>

                        <p>In fact health professionals are not immune to having to “be there” for their own family, friends, or colleagues as demonstrated by Pat’s Group.

                        <p>Jackie Crandall, a Clinical Nurse Specialist, had no sooner attended a STC Training in London, Ontario when she found herself in a position to apply what she had just learned to help a nursing colleague diagnosed with a terminal illness.  Led by Jackie, other hospital staff rallied to help their co-worker Pat and her family by creating a Team of 30 strong in just days.</p>

There were a lot of tears, a lot of laughter, a lot of sharing of deep feelings. They all expressed their feeling that they gave Pat a wonderful gift, and Pat gave them a greater gift.”</p>

                        <h1>STC Can Support Your Patients and Families</h1>

                        <h2>The Person Needing The Care</h2>

                        <p>Since 1995, the STC model has demonstrated the ability to make a difference, regardless of the situation. No matter if a person (adult, teen or child) is in need of short-term or long-term rehabilitation following surgery, an accident or combat; has a disability; or is suffering from long-term or terminal illness, STC can help. The model is also used to support people struggling with the difficulties associated with aging.</p>
                        
                        <p>STC teams have assisted people facing other difficult situations including: the frail elderly living alone; a widower with 7 kids; people recovering from a broken back and/or limbs; parents with newborn quadruplets, triplets, and preemie twins; grandparents raising small children; and teens transitioning to foster care, as well as someone with a hoarding issue.</p>
                        
                        <p>Today a significant and a growing number of people live alone. Many who are ill or disabled live alone far from family or without any family at all. What better antidote to fear and isolation than a “created family”.</p>
                        
                        <p class="last">The only thing that limits STC is one’s imagination.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h2>Health Professionals Help A STC Group</h2>
                        
                        <p>Because the model is rooted in teamwork and making the most of everyone’s time, experience and skill sets, STC can be applied to any situation to provide comfort for the person needing the care...</p>

                        <p>The following example demonstrates how health professionals taught family caregivers and team members (who felt comfortable doing so) critical homecare skills for an ALS patient.</p>

                        <h2>Peg’s Legs – by Kimi Chun</h2>

                        <p>We knew that Peggy would not thrive in a nursing home – and everyone made a commitment to care for her in her home.</p>

                        <p>While Peggy went in for her tracheostomy, the group met to discuss what Peggy’s new needs were going to be and how we needed to re-organize. We enlisted a private nursing organization to train our volunteers and help us through the transition. Peggy had excellent healthcare though not enough to cover 24 hours for the entire year. The plan was train our Peg’s Legs volunteers so that they could take over the daytime nursing hours.</p>

                        <p>We had 3 shifts a day covered by our STC volunteers and we used private hire nurses overnight. Each Peg’s Legs shift had what we called an “A” person and a “B” person. The “A” person was trained to manage the ventilator and do the medical stuff and the “B” person was there to assist them and do light household chores, etc. We also had “C” people – they came by when they could  – whenever that might have been.</p>

                        <p>We had 2 people on every shift – 3 shifts a day – that’s 6 volunteers a day – <span class="bold">everyday</span>! And many of these volunteers were new friends. Thanks to them, we saved thousands every month in nursing expenses. We still had to supplement with fundraising, but our large network got the word out.</p>

                        <p><span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) is a highly regarded grassroots caregiving model used throughout the U.S., Canada and other countries to help people who are in need of support.  It was created from the real-life needs and the experiences of 12 women (who didn’t know each other) who cared for a terminally ill friend. By working closely together for nearly four years they learned to create a model that could support their friend as well as themselves, so no one person had too much to do and each managed to keep her own life in good working order.</p>

                        <p>During this overview of the STC model, participants learn about the key STC systems and see examples of STC in action in other communities as well as some of the inspiring accomplishments of STC groups from around the world.</p>

                        <h4 class="program-heading">(for caregivers and concerned friends)</h4>

                        <p>A friend tells you of a loved one’s illness. Another says she or he is caring for an aging parent. A couple faces long-term health issues with no outside support. We’ve all said it – because it’s the most universal, most instinctive reaction: “What can I do to help?” Everyone will be touched by caregiving at some point in life. What can each of us do now so that we are better prepared for our turn at bat? And how can we avoid burning out?</p>

                        <p>During this introduction to the <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) model, you’ll hear the hear the story of how the first STC group was born and, what happened to inspire the authors to write the STC guidebook so that others could follow in their footsteps.</p>

                        <p>The presentation includes examples of STC groups who have gone above and beyond the usual caregiving “call of duty” and their very inspiring accomplishments.</p>

                        <p>This presentation is about “community” at its best.</p>

                        <p>A perfect presentation for: general public, caregiver events and conferences and support groups.</p>

                        <p>Today more and more people live alone far from family; or they have no family.  What happens when they need help?  Who will care for them?</p>

                        <p>This presentation is filled with stories of groups that came to the rescue of individuals without family, or spouse, or relatives who could take on a caregiver role.</p>

                        <p>The audience learns through storytelling of how “created <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) families” have overcome some very difficult challenges.  And though these families cannot cure, they can heal.
                        This presentations includes what it takes to start a STC group as well as important suggestions on how we can each “be better prepared” should we ever need support–no matter if we have family or not.</p>

                        <p>If your organization or institution works with caregivers who are ready to accept a <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) group, but need guidance to get started we offer a special workshop. Because the initial STC group meeting is designed to be organized and led by two committed friends, each caregiver will need to enlist them to attend.</p>

                        <p>Working together in little groups within a larger group, people feel more encouraged and less alone in their need for outside support.</p>

                        <p>Following background stories and examples of what groups are capable of doing we walk everyone through each of the steps needed to organize and maintain their first STC meeting. Lots of Q & A and sharing.</p>

                        <p>If a care recipient has no family caregiver – this is a wonderful way for two friends to start a “caregiving family” to support them.</p>

                        <p>Following this workshop each should leave with plan of action and a sense of confidence and enthusiasm about accepting help.</p>

                        <p>This workshop is between 3 – 3.5 hours (depending on number of people.) There is minimum of 30 people.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">Materials:</span> Each participant receives a copy of the STC guidebook and a special workbook that includes 23 STC forms, handouts and suggestions.</p>

                        <p class="last">This workshop would be ideal for disease specific organizations or for programs focused on helping the caregivers of our military and veterans.</p>

                        <p>“Seeding <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) in Your Community” Program is a full-day professional training designed <span class="italic">specifically</span> for health professionals and the clergy. It gives you the tools and the knowledge to, introduce STC to your patients, families, parishioners and encourages them to consider STC as a positive and rewarding caregiving option. The training is limited to 40 to 60 participants.</p>

                        <p>The program is accredited by the NorthEast Multi-State Division RN Continuing Education Unit so that RNs can receive continuing education credits (6.25 hrs).</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Who can be trained?</h3>
                        <p>Nurses, social workers, hospice workers, hospital discharge personnel, chaplains, geriatric care managers, aging specialists, therapists, support group program leaders, students of social work and nursing. Volunteers who work in hospice or faith-based programs, and in caregiver support programs are also well positioned to identify needs and help people understand the benefits that can result from a created “caregiving family”.</p>
                        
                        <p class="last">Interested local and government organizations, faith communities, hospitals and hospices have pooled funds or received grants to host a training in order to establish the STC model locally.</p>

                        <h1>STC Stations</h1>
                        
                        <p>In order to successfully disseminate the STC model locally, following a training, an organization (or several organizations or faith communities) may choose to create a “STC Station.”</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="bold">The purpose of a STC Station is to:</h4>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>Promote and provide information about STC</li>
                            <li>Coach those who need assistance to get a STC group going</li>
                            <li>Offer local resources and referrals as necessary</li>
                            <li class="last">Provide feedback on local STC group activity to STCG</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Flyers, small space ads, articles, posters, and brochures are placed in community centers, places of worship, pharmacies, hospitals, and libraries to engage people and make them aware of the Station, the handbook and the STC website.</p>

                        <img src="img/health-photos/STC-Station-Campaign.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center1">

                        <p>Each piece of advertising invites them to call a local number to learn more about the model and/or to receive coaching to start a group.</p>
                        
                        <p>Community outreach is one aspect of a Station Manager’s role. They make presentations to support groups, clubs, associations, faith communities, community centers, or anywhere people gather. They also do interviews for their local newspapers, radio or TV stations.</p>
                        
                        <p>Social workers, parish nurses, counseling professionals, trained volunteers or even past Share The Care group participants are ideal to do this work. The main requirement is passion... we call them “STC Champions.”</p>

                        <p>A Station can be located in a small corner within an office with a computer. It’s best to choose a space where people already go to access healthcare advice or information (e.g., clinics, hospice, faith communities, and community centers where support programs are offered.)</p>

                            <h4><span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> Two Year Initiative in SW Ontario</h4>
                            <h4 class="stc-commune2">Paul Cavanagh, former Director of the South West End-of-Life Care Network.</h4>

                            <p><span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) received a huge boost when the South West Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) funded a two-year knowledge transfer campaign in Ontario, Canada from 2009 to 2011. The campaign resulted in over 100 information sessions and numerous training workshops. Even more importantly, it created a network of 40 local champions and 5 STC stations across the region.</p>

                            <p>The idea wasn’t just to spread the word about STC for two years, it was to create a well of knowledge and experience that people could draw on in subsequent years.</p>

                            <img src="img/health-photos/STC-room-SW-ONT.jpg" class="img-responsive stc-action-img">

                            <p>Although the campaign was orchestrated through the South West End-of-Life Care Network, it involved a wide variety of organizations, including churches, libraries, employee assistance programs, primary care teams, seniors services, home care, hospices, local Alzheimer Societies, as well as other community support services. It was led by campaign coordinator, Eugene Dufour.</p>

                            <div class="stc-action-img">

                            </div>


                            <p>Five different community organizations stepped up to host STC Stations across the region. <a href="http://www.southwesthealthline.ca">SouthWesthealthline.ca</a> (a website with over one million hits a year that offers a consumer-oriented database of health and social services in the South West) created a mini-site called the Caregiver Exchange <a href="http://www.caregiverexchange.ca">www.caregiverexchange.ca</a> that features caregiving advice and resources, including information about regional STC resources.</p>

                            <p>A summative evaluation at the end of the campaign revealed that 4,100 people attended information sessions and almost 7,000 information packages were distributed at various presentations, health fairs, and conferences. It’s estimated that 63 caregiving groups were formed, although the number could be higher. Most were created to support people at the end of their lives.</p>

                            <div class="stc-action-img">

                            <p>Perhaps the most telling result from the campaign evaluation was that care recipients and their families were very appreciative of the support they received. On the flip side, group participants were very satisfied with their experience and said they would get involved again. “Participating in a caregiving group was a gift for us,” said one group participant</p>

                            <p class="last">Utilizing the statewide network of professionals that serve family caregivers, a train-the-trainer approach is used to introduce the STC model to establish STC Stations. There are currently 15 STC Stations in Wisconsin. Several additional counties are scheduled to have a training in the coming months.</p>

                            <p>One of the first STC Stations, launched in 2012, had the opportunity to record a radio public service announcement that played regularly. Several other counties have also been able to record similar PSAs.</p>

                            <p>There has also been interest in establishing STC Stations specifically for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) communities (Madison has a STC within the LGBT community center). STC works well in this community as the model offers a sustainable way of organizing their support network, which includes “families of choice.”</p>

                            <p>Claire facilitates quarterly conference calls to support existing STC Stations that highlight such topics as outreach and promotion; overcoming barriers to accepting help; and most recently a speaker from the State Office on Aging (Dementia Specialist) who spoke about the State’s new Dementia Redesign, utilizing STC as a complement to the Memory Care Connections Program, a six-week evidenced-based program designed to assist and support caregivers of those with dementia.</p>

                            <p class="last">With the help of Station Managers, STC groups have been forming and the model has been featured in several local newspapers.</p>

                                <h2>RE: Share the Care</h2>

                                <p>This was a challenging year for me and my family. My 77 year old “hermit like” father-in-law had been contacted by the city to clean up the inside and outside of his home due to a neighbor complaining about his hoarding. We had no choice to send him up north to live with his daughter while we sorted through 30 years of junk that he considered treasures. It took five months to just empty the house which allowed us to see the true condition. We planned to renovate the home so my mother-in-law could move back in and care for my father-in-law in a clean, healthy environment.  The truth was, this was going to be a bigger job than we’d expected. The foundation on two walls was in very poor condition and allowed rain to get into the basement. The wiring, windows, roof, plumbing, furnace and water heater were original from when the house was built in 1954 which made them inefficient and dangerous. It now became mine and my husband’s job to get the house back in livable condition.</p>

                                <p>In July it was necessary for him to come back to Milwaukee to be near his doctor. Because the house was under construction there was no choice but to have him and my mother-in-law move in with us. We went to work during the day and then work at the house until 9-10 pm. We also did this on the weekends which left little time for us to attend to the things that needed to get done at our home. Little things like buy bread or milk, make a meal, or mow the lawn took a backseat. But it’s the little things that pile up and cause stress.</p>

                                <p class="last">Dar and Ruth pulled together our closest family and friends. They discussed each person’s strength and came up with a two week calendar of small jobs each could do to take something off mine and my husband’s personal “to do list”. There were four complete meals that were dropped off at my home. After a 14 hour day, instead of having to make a meal, all I had to do was pop it in the oven. Overdue gardening was all taken care of so we didn’t have to do it. Twice someone came over and vacuumed for us. A friend who is a masseuse came over and gave me a massage and another gave me and my mother-in-law a pedicure. It took us a day or so to realize that a pile of tree branches that we cut down a week prior were gone. A family member made that phone call to the city for a pickup. These were all simple daily tasks that don’t seem like much unless you already have too much to do. <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> allowed us to get through much easier. This is an amazing program. When we are absorbed in taking care of someone who needs us we tend to forget to take care of ourselves. That’s where the program comes in. I thank Dar and Ruth for the <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> Program.</p>

                                <h2>We're Working Our Way Into Sally's Heart–Through Her Dogs</h2>
                                <h3>By Dana Nelson</h3>

                                <p>I have started a mini-<span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> group. Part of what drew me to STC originally was that it was such a natural fit for who I am.  I say it is a mini-group because the group is comprised of people with a special interest – we didn’t open it up and reach out to others for a couple of different reasons the main one being the care recipient wasn’t really open to help in the first place. So we kinda <span class="italic">“forced”</span> ourselves on her. Here is how it went down.</p>

                                <p>Those of us in this group are all connected through dogs. We all train and show dogs with the same breeder/trainer. We all vary in age and how long we have known Sally. I have known her for 8 years. She is my mother’s age but she is one of my dearest friends.</p>

                                <p>My friend Sally has Rheumatoid Arthritis. She is in her late 60s.  Over the past 7 years the RA has become very bad causing her to retire early and to give up some of the things she loves. But she won’t give up everything she should for her health sake and she doesn’t always use the best judgment – for example her bones break easily so she should be careful when she walks – but she doesn’t want the disease to control her so she walks in the woods instead of on the paved driveway!</p>

                                <p>She has fallen at least three times and twice broken bones. This most recent surgery (she has had nearly every joint in her body replaced) was a wrist fusion. She had this surgery in March, but it wouldn’t heal and she developed a bone infection so they ended up having to fuse her wrist.</p>

                                <p>She is not going to be able to continue to care for herself and her husband. Although he is helpful, he isn’t used to caring for Sally who is a former nurse and very stubborn. She feels that she can take care of herself and that she should also continue to cook, and clean for her husband. We all knew that we just HAD to start showing up at her house to help out around the house and with meals.</p>

                                <p>So I started a group on Facebook exclusive to just our little dog-show group. On Facebook you can have a <span class="italic">“secret”</span> group where others can’t see your posts and you can be exclusive as to who is in the group. It worked perfectly. We found that it was the best way to communicate. We had people stop over every day – one day they would bring a meal and the other day they would help with something. Sally never really caught on until about day 3 or 4 that we were intentionally doing this. By then she realized that she needed some help and was pretty accepting.</p>

                                <p>We continued this every day for three weeks and now people are routinely stopping in every other day. We also connect with her everyday via the phone. On Tuesday I spoke to her and found out that she just had an X-ray and it revealed small compression fractures on her spine. So it has become clear that we will be continuing our every other day scenario for a while.</p>

                                <p>The neat thing about this group is that we KNOW that she is more concerned about her dogs and so we are approaching the help from that perspective – we stop over to see how <span class="italic">“THEY”</span> are doing and while we are there we bathe them for her and gosh, we might as well vacuum too! At this point, she would still not be accepting of support from a large STC group with people (including family) from her other world. It truly blesses us to bless her with things that we are happy to do to help.</p>

                                <p class="last">I am so glad that our county here in Wisconsin has such a great STC attitude. I only wish more people who need it would use it and accept it.</p>

                            <p>Individual communities (and in this case an island) have their own challenges and ways of applying the STC model. The following example demonstrates how STC can be applied using volunteers to fill in the gaps as STC blends beautifully with the local customs and culture for those living far from family on the mainland.</p>

                            <h4>Deborah Duda, Lead STC Coordinator</h4>
                            <h4 class="stc-commune2">Deborah is also the author of <span class="italic">Coming Home, A Practical and Compassionate Guide to Caring for a Dying Loved One.</span></h4>

                            <p>Kauai STC – an island-wide volunteer, grassroots movement- is dedicated to making life easier for our caregivers. Because of the inspired visions of Sheila Warnock and Lori Miller, Kauai Hospice Executive director, we are a project of Kauai Hospice, although not limited to families facing terminal illness.</p>

                            <p>How does it work? After Sheila came to Kauai and inspired and trained 55 volunteers, we divided Kauai into six regions, each with a volunteer regional coordinator, and an overall coordinator, Deborah Duda. She receives referrals and coordinates with compassionate social workers island wide and groups such as Office of Elderly Affairs, Ho’ola Lahui Hawaii, RSVP, Habitat for Humanity, and private home health agencies.</p>

                            <img src="img/health-photos/TMKMapSm.jpg" class="img-responsive stc-action-img">

                            <p>Then, regional coordinators meet with families to access their needs and help them to organize their resources – family, friends, coworkers, and faith community members – into caring teams. For caregivers without sufficient family and friends, STC volunteers from their area, if available, fill in to form <span class="italic">hanai</span> – extended – families.</p>

                            <p>Besides helping individual families, The STC program focuses on community development, on increasing our resident’s sense of belonging – being cared about and cared for.</p>

                            <img src="img/health-photos/Hawaii-groups1.jpg" class="img-responsive">

                            <p>Deborah gives numerous presentations on the STC model and how it has been adapted to island life and styles to local social service agencies and support groups – Rotary and Lions Clubs, AARP, and Alzheimer’s, ALS, dialysis, and Parkinson’s support groups.  Habitat for Humanity supports us by donating needed supplies such as grab bars, ceiling fans, and furniture for our families.</p>

                            <img src="img/health-photos/Hawaii-groups2.jpg" class="img-responsive">

                            <p>A STC volunteer, who is also a hospice volunteer, helped organize a three building senior apartment complex with 300 residents into caring teams. On hearing that the elevators in each building had to be replaced, the coordinator was concerned. During the month long installation period, second and third floor residents would only be able to exit using a steep flight of stairs. For many elderly and disabled residents that was impossible. The coordinator organized services such a running errands, food shopping, picking up the mail, and walking dogs. The first elevator was replaced with a lot of camaraderie and tenants’ needs met. Two more to go!!</p>

                            <p>In conclusion, Kauai STC is a widely recognized and valued island service. The mayor and county council have both issued proclamations of appreciation.</p>

                        <p>Amy Hegenger, a PhD candidate at the School of Social Welfare at the State University of Albany, is working on a comprehensive evaluation of the STC model’s impact on key stakeholders: care recipients, their primary caregiver, and the STC group members.</p>

                        <p>Amy works at the New York State Office for the Aging in the area of long term care, systems planning and analysis and also has experience as a hospital social worker. Her primary research interest is in older adult activity and volunteerism. She heard Sheila speak about STC at a conference in Albany, and knew her organization was seeking a researcher to do a study on the value of STC.</p>

                        <p>The study was initiated this summer. People were asked to complete an online survey and were also invited to participate in a follow up phone conversation with the researcher. Over 50% of participants indicated that they would be willing to do so. The final paper is expected to be complete and ready for publication and presentations by the Spring 2015.</p>

                        <p>This research is a first step in developing an evidence base that we believe will document the effectiveness of the STC model in achieving important public policy goals.</p>

                        <h4>(From last sub-section – Social Epigenetics)</h4>

                        <blockquote>“Collective social intelligence can offer an alternative to the overwhelming toll of caregiving. Witness the scene in Sandwich, New Hampshire, where Philip Simmons sat in his wheelchair on a brilliant fall day, surrounded by friends and neighbors. At age thirty-five Simmons, a college English teacher with two small children, had been diagnosed with the degenerative neurological condition Lou Gehrig’s disease and given two to five years to live. He had already outlived his prognosis, but now the paralysis was moving from his lower body to his arms, making him unable to perform even routine tasks. At this point he gave a friend a book called Share The Care, which describes how to create an ongoing support group for someone with a severe illness.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>Thirty-five neighbors rallied to help Simmons and his family. Coordinating their schedule largely by phone and email, they acted as cooks, drivers, babysitters, home aides – and, as on that fall day, yard workers–for the last several years of Simmons’s life, until he died at age forty-five. This virtual extended family made an immense difference for Simmons and his wife, Kathryn Field. Not least, their help enabled Field to continue her work as a professional artist, easing the financial strain and giving the entire family, in her words, “a sense of being loved by our community.”</blockquote>

                        <blockquote class="last">As for those who formed FOPAK (Friends of Phil and Kathryn), as they called themselves, most agreed that they were the ones receiving the gift.</blockquote>

I wish that all hospitals could hand it out when they give you a diagnosis for ALS. I wish you could get a grant to have it placed in every hospital waiting room and doctor’s office. Everyone knows someone who could benefit from reading it.”</blockquote>

                        <p>Now and In the coming decades, cuts to funded caregiving programs and services as well as the lack of caregivers (both professionals and younger potential caregivers) will make the faith communities throughout the world the place where people will turn for support.</p>

                        <p>Though this role is not an unfamiliar one, having a faith community that is well prepared to support their members who are ill, aging or in need of care is critical. We believe the benefits of an organized teamwork approach like <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) can make a profound difference.</p>

                        <p>Over the last 20 years, the STC model has demonstrated the flexibility that groups welcome, and an effective plan of action to guide them, saving precious time trying to figure out who should do what.</p>

                        <p>As people age they tend to grow more spiritual. And for older adults or others who have no family, their faith community will need to step up to the plate and become <a href="italic">“family”.</a></p>

                        <p class="last">The philosophy and principles of the STC approach are based in a loving and compassionate approach that embraces all forms of faith.</p>

                        <h3>Wherever One or Two are Gathered</h3>
                        <h4>by Sheila Reed</h4>
                        
                        <p>For the past several years, I have spent most of my Sunday mornings at the Church of Lynn. Its sanctuary is half of a double room at the Founders Pavilion nursing facility in Corning. Its patron saint is Lynn Van Atta, my friend for over thirty years, although she would snort at any notion of saintliness.</p>

                        <p>Lynn suffers from a degenerative brain disorder that has gradually stolen her vision, her mobility, and her sense of time and space. She is tethered to the world by the ministrations of her caregivers and the daily visits of family and friends. Each of us has staked ourselves to a portion of Lynn’s week, when we arrive to share food and conversation, to read words of wisdom and comfort, to laugh over old stories.</p>

                        <p>My time is Sunday morning. I wend my way through the wheelchairs clustered by the third floor nurses’ station and arrive at room 306. Whether she is in bed or in the geriatric chair that holds her head and body steady, Lynn’s face beams at the sound of my greeting. Her eyes are often lidded or fully closed; Lynn sees without them. Her world is lit from within by little joys and epiphanies: the tart taste of apple on her tongue, a snatch of song from the past, the memory of a day on the beach with her beloved granddaughters.</p>

                        <p>This is my worship. To be in the presence of a soul growing ever closer to the light, whose illness has robbed her body of almost everything it can, save life itself, and acceptance, and grace in the face of terrible loss. A determination to live out her days with gratefulness for the things that remain.</p>

                        <p class="last">It is in this presence that I approach my own best self. I am patient with Lynn’s frequent confusions, tender with my words. I battle with her the fearful images that her ravaged brain generates. We make our way through the verses of “Amazing Grace.” I sing her the song she loves by Libby Roderick:</p>

                        <blockquote>How could anyone ever tell you/ You were anything less than beautiful? How could anyone ever tell you/ You were less than whole?</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>How could anyone fail to notice that your loving is a miracle?</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>These are our Sunday hymns. I place slices of clementine and bits of banana bread between Lynn’s lips slip some into my own mouth. This is our communion.</blockquote>

                        <p class="last">Throughout my life I have experienced the presence of God in a variety of places, both humble and grand. Right now my church is half of a double room on the third floor of Founders Pavilion in Corning, New York.</p>

                        <p>“A young family placed membership at our church and we learned that they were expecting Quads in the fall. Many of our church family told them they would be there to help – I wanted to help as well but was home with Marcie on a daily basis. (Marcie is Linda’s daughter and has ALS)</p>
                        
                        <p>(Then) I woke up with an idea. I called my church to see if anyone had volunteered to organize caring for the babies but no one had. So I told the church secretary my plan about how we could <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> for these newborns as my church family had helped me. I could organize everything at home on my computer while I was caring for Marcie.</p>
                        
                        <p>I went to the hospital to meet the mom of the soon to be Quads and her mom who lives two hours away. I wrote the plan down – how we had run “Marcie’s Guardian Angels”... As I left the hospital room I finally realized what “Marcie’s Guardian Angels” had been telling me all those years. I was so blessed to have the knowledge the Share The Care™ book had given me so that I could help this family expecting four new babies all at one time. I knew I could do it – I knew it would work – it had for my family.</p>
                        
                        <p>So the plan is in place – I made one sign up sheet listing the five different specialized teams: Lawn care, Housekeeping, Meals, Donations, and Childcare. All five teams lead by five leaders will be guided by the <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> system.</p>

                        <p>Last Sunday we had a “signing day” after church – about 80 people had their pictures taken. We did this since both the young couple and I needed to put a name to a face before anyone came to their home. We have a very large church – everyone does not know everyone else. We also had people fill out background checks. Our church housed “guests” from the Hurricane Katrina disaster so this was “old hat” for our members now.</p>
                        
                        <p>We’ll be going by the name... “The Diaper Darlings.”</p>

                        <p>The Quads have about 50 adopted Mom’s, Grandma’s, Great Grandma’s and Grandpa’s who love them dearly. I can’t put myself on the weekly schedule since I am caring for Marcie, however, I get my “baby fix” when visiting on weekends. For four months the Diaper Darlings have been there from 7:00 a.m. till 9:00 p.m. with three families spending the nights two days a week.  Now that the Quads are sleeping through the night, we just need to cover from 9:30 am till 6:00 pm. And soon we’ll be cutting back even more from 1:00 p.m. till 6:30 p.m.</p>

                        <p>Suzanne, means so much to me now. I have adopted her and her husband, Joe, and all four babies. I was so lucky to have the knowledge of how to organize this wonderful group of Christian men and women who make up the Diaper Darlings. Suzanne has enough confidence in our team now that she can take a nap or run to the store if she needs to and we’re there for them on weekends, as needed. And that’s when I get to help!  On Sunday mornings I’m there so Joe and Suzanne can go to church.</p>

I’m so blessed to be able to offer this assistance to so many families. It feels so good to be able to “give back” the gifts given to me, and my family, while caring for my daughter, Marcie.</p>

                        <p>“Seeding <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) in Your Community” Program is a full-day professional training designed specifically for health professionals and the clergy. It gives you the tools and the knowledge to, introduce STC to your patients, families, parishioners and encourages them to consider STC as a positive and rewarding caregiving option. The training is limited to 40 to 60 participants.</p>
                        
                        <p>The program is accredited by the VT State Nurses’ Association so that RNs can receive continuing education credits (6.25 hrs).</p>

                        <p><span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) is a highly regarded grassroots caregiving model used throughout the U.S., Canada and other countries to help people who are in need of support. It was created from the real-life needs and the experiences of 12 women (who didn’t know each other) who cared for a terminally ill friend. By working closely together for nearly four years they learned to create a model that could support their friend as well as themselves, so no one person had too much to do and each managed to keep her own life in good working order.</p>

                        <p>Professionals will learn the first steps needed to organize the critical first meeting of a STC group and why working as a close-knit team maintains the group’s long-term ability to sustain their support. During this overview of the STC model, participants learn about the key STC systems and see examples of STC in action in other communities as well as some of the inspiring accomplishments of STC groups from around the world.</p>

                        <p>A friend tells you of a loved one’s illness. Another says she or he is caring for an aging parent. A couple faces long-term health issues with no outside support. We’ve all said it – because it’s the most universal, most instinctive reaction: “What can I do to help?” Everyone will be touched by caregiving at some point in life. What can each of us do now so that we are better prepared for our turn at bat? And how can we avoid burning out?</p>

                        <p>During this introduction to the <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) model, you’ll hear the hear the story of how the first STC group was born and, what happened to inspire the authors to write the STC guidebook so that others could follow in their footsteps.</p>

                        <p>The presentation includes examples of STC groups who have gone above and beyond the usual caregiving “call of duty” and their very inspiring accomplishments.</p>

                        <p>This presentation is about <span class="italic">"“community”</span> at its best.</p>

                        <p>A perfect presentation for: general public, faith communities, events and conferences and support groups.</p>

                        <p>Today more and more people live alone far from family; or they have no family. What happens when they need help?  Who will care for them?</p>

                        <p>This presentation is filled with stories of groups that came to the rescue of individuals without family, or spouse, or relatives who could take on a caregiver role.</p>

                        <p>The audience learns through storytelling of how “created <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) families” have overcome some very difficult challenges. And though these families cannot cure, they can heal.</p>
                            
                        <p>This presentations includes what it takes to start a STC group as well as important suggestions on how we can each “be better prepared” should we ever need support–no matter if we have family or not.</p>

                        <h4 class="smaller program-heading">(caregivers, care recipients without a caregiver and two committed friends for each)</h4>

                        <h4 class="bold">Workshop Description:</h4>

                        <p>If your organization or institution works with caregivers who are ready to accept a <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) group, but need guidance to get started we offer a special workshop. Because the initial STC group meeting is designed to be organized and led by two committed friends, each caregiver will need to enlist them to attend.</p>

                        <p>Working together in little groups within a larger group, people feel more encouraged and less alone in their need for outside support.</p>

                        <p>Following background stories and examples of what groups are capable of doing we walk everyone through each of the steps needed to organize and maintain their first STC meeting. Lots of Q & A and sharing.</p>

                        <p>If a care recipient has no family caregiver – this is a wonderful way for two friends to start a “caregiving family” to support them.</p>

                        <p>Following this workshop each should leave with plan of action and a sense of confidence and enthusiasm about accepting help.</p>

                        <p>This workshop is between 3 – 3.5 hours (depending on number of people.) There is minimum of 30 people.</p>

                        <p><span class="last bold">Materials:</span> Each participant receives a copy of the STC guidebook and a special workbook that includes 23 STC forms, handouts and suggestions.</p>

                        <blockquote>“Our church is using STC to coordinate caregiving to assure that we all truly take care of each other, sharing the tasks, with each person contributing exactly what they have time to do and what they most enjoy doing. It’s just amazing the difference it is making and how meaningful it rapidly became to participants. We try to make sure that everyone has what they need-both caregivers and people we reach. It’s an awesome model for churches and we’d love to help spread it to more congregations!”</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>A senior participant concludes (in her wonderful Portuguese accent): “This is what going to church is really all about: Loving each other!”</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>“It has been a terribly sad deterioration, and (Lynn’s) ability to communicate has changed in the last few weeks. Lynn has many friends and our STC group remains at about 20. We have changed our five member women’s group of 30 years from visiting in each other’s homes to meeting at her nursing facility every other week. She can no longer attend church and so her Friend’s group comes to her once a month. Lynn is frightened by the changes happening to her, and since her memory is declining as well, she cannot remember our daily visits, but we continue to go since when we are with her, she calms down and feels safer.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>The facility staff has often commented on her loving group. Her roommate has become an unofficial part of the group and we all appreciate her caring, too. I call her Lynn’s Guardian Angel....</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>This is a difficult time for the STC group, as well, in dealing with our own feelings of loss and sorrow for our friend, but we have called on one another to support each other and share that caring as well.”</blockquote>

                        <ol>

                            <li>offer local resources and referrals as necessary</li>

                        <p>Flyers, small space ads, articles, posters, and brochures are placed in community centers, places of worship, pharmacies, hospitals, and libraries to engage people and make them aware of the Station, the handbook and the STC website.</p>

                        <img src="img/health-photos/STC-Station-Campaign.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center1">
                        
                        <p>Each piece of advertising invites them to call a local number to learn more about the model and/or to receive coaching to start a group.</p>
                        
                        <p>Community outreach is one aspect of a Station Manager’s role. They make presentations to support groups, clubs, associations, faith communities, community centers, or anywhere people gather. They also do interviews for their local newspapers, radio or TV stations.</p>

                        <p>Social workers, parish nurses, counseling professionals, trained volunteers or even past Share The Care group participants are ideal to do this work. The main requirement is passion... we call them “STC Champions.”</p>

                        <p class="last">A Station can be located in a small corner within an office with a computer. It’s best to choose a space where people already go to access healthcare advice or information (e.g., clinics, hospice, faith communities, and community centers where support programs are offered.)</p>

                        <p class="corps-head">The Corps is the brainchild of Greg Johnson. His vision for the Corps follows:</p>

                        <p><span class="italic">Family Caregiving</span> has many faces and at some point in our lives each of us becomes a family caregiver and most of us will also be cared for by others.</p>
                        
                        <p>Family Caregivers are the backbone of the world’s healthcare systems... both families of origin and families of choice. We at EmblemHealth applaud and salute each.</p>

                        <p>The intersection, the convergence of work life and family caregiving is an important point of focus that for too long has not been given its needed attention. Recent studies have shown that corporate USA loses between $17 and 38 <span class="italic">Billion</span> annually for family caregiving related issues... absenteeism and presenteeism are only the beginning points for this loss. I have always felt we are persons dedicated to family caregiving and family caregivers can help to change that. Fortunately, EmblemHealth, a NYC base Health and Wellness Corporation has been bringing focus, attention, awareness, tools and resources to family caregivers for well over a decade and I have been the person blessed to create and implement EmblemHealth’s Care for the Family Caregiver Initiative.</p>

                        <p>It is true that with family caregiving one cannot <span class="italic">pay</span> it away; <span class="italic">pray</span> it away or <span class="italic">prescribe</span> it away... <span class="bold">you need all three</span>... but ultimately you need to go through it and it is our hope that you will <span class="italic">grow</span> through it.</p>

                        <p>To that end with the support of EmblemHealth... I created the <span class="italic">NYC Partnership For Family Caregiving Corps</span>... literally an “army” for the corporations... and “army” of family caregiving “generalists” who stand ready to help bring about <span class="italic">Awareness</span>... <span class="italic">Acceptance</span> and <span class="italic">Action</span> bringing help and hope to family caregivers and their care recipients alike.</p>

                        <p class="last">Sheila Warnock and <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span>... are key, vital partners in this mission. We salute you with deep gratitude and affection. Onward...</p>

                        <p><span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) grew out of a meeting with twelve women who showed up to support a mutual friend who was a divorced, working mom (for a large Fortune 500 company) with two young teens, and a rare terminal cancer. The video describes how they came up with the key system (The Rotating Captains System) By working this way, no one burned out while they cared for her over three and a half years.</p>

                        <p class="last">You may know of a co-worker who is struggling with caregiving responsibilities or who may be working while they undergo treatment for an illness. Please do consider ways you can lighten their load in and out of the office, just like the friends, co-workers and acquaintances who showed up for Susan. If a co-worker has no family nearby, your concern and assistance will be one of the greatest gifts you can offer. A little compassion can be the turning point between despair and relief.</p>

                        <h1>Caregiving is the Toughest Job in the World</h1>
                        
                        <p>Caregiving is the toughest job in the world. And for the working caregiver it can be a living nightmare — It’s like being suffocated by an overwhelming, terrifyingly complex job with no relief in sight.</p>
                        
                        <p>Many of us have been there.</p>

                        <p>Difficulties crop up in the workplace because far too many employees hide the fact they’re shouldering such a responsibility. They fear losing their job. Or they don’t know how to ask for help. Or they just think they have to do it alone. Others may know of their struggles and offer help but rarely does anyone know how to turn those offers into positive action.</p>

                        <p>Employers have taken decisive steps to assist through a variety of programs:  job sharing, telecommuting, compressed work schedules, flex time, leave without pay and much more.</p>

                        <p>Yet in spite of all this flexibility, working caregivers continue to be overwhelmed <span class="bold">because they just don’t have enough support at home</span>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Besides their job, they shoulder complex emotional and physical demands in addition to household chores, meals, as well as critical errands and responsibilities that inevitably lead to isolation and depression.</p>
                        
                        <p>Yet there is a simple, effective and compassionate solution that can provide a true benefit to your caregiver employees — at minimum consequence to you both financially and emotionally. Just like the team-building models you use to solve critical concerns in your organization, our team-building model is there to solve caregiving issues.</p>

                        <p>It’s called <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span>.</p>  

                        <p>It was born out of real life experience and need. The model has empowered hundreds of thousands of friends, relatives, neighbors, acquaintances and co-workers with a step-by-step plan to form and maintain their own caregiving team to take on all kinds of caregiving challenges be they simple or complex.</p>

                        <p>A STC team supports <span class="italic">not just</span> the person needing care but also their primary caregiver and other family members. Anywhere from 8 to 80 participants collaborate to share responsibilities and allocate jobs based on schedule, skill and capability.</p>

                        <p>The immediate result for the caregiver employee is a visible reduction of stress, and improved overall physical and emotional well-being. As one caregiver put it: <span class="bold">“I began to breathe again.”</span></p>
                            
                        <p>No matter if one is caring for a chronically ill child, an aging parent, a spouse with a debilitating long-term illness or a short-term injury — the experience of sharing the care builds a sense of community both in and out of the office.</p>

                        <p>The model teaches participants the value of working together to become stronger, more informed and more experienced for a time when they will inevitably need to take on the role of caregiver for their own family.</p>

                        <p class="last">Together with everyone in the <span class="italic">NYC Partnership for Family Caregiver Corps</span>, <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span>’s goal is to work with you to reverse the negative equation of caregiving in the workplace, restore productivity and help your caregiver employees and their loved ones experience a better “quality of life.”</p>

                        <h4 class="program-heading">(for management conference on caregiver issues)</h4>

                        <p><span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) is a highly regarded grassroots caregiving model used throughout the U.S., Canada and other countries to help people who are in need of support. It was created from the real-life needs and the experiences of 12 women (who didn’t know each other) who cared for a terminally ill friend. By working closely together for nearly four years they learned to create a model that could support their friend as well as themselves, so no one person had too much to do and each managed to keep her own life in good working order.</p>

                        <p>Management personnel will learn the first steps needed to organize the critical first meeting of a STC group and why working as a close-knit team maintains the group’s long-term ability to sustain their support.</p>

                        <p>During this overview of the STC model, participants learn about the key STC systems and see examples of STC in action in other communities as well as some of the inspiring accomplishments of STC groups from around the world.</p>

                        <p>The goal is to make them aware of a resource that can help their employees who could benefit from this kind of support.</p>

                        <h4 class="program-heading">(for all employees)</h4>

                        <p>A friend tells you of a loved one’s illness. Another says she or he is caring for an aging parent. A couple faces long-term health issues with no outside support. We’ve all said it—because it’s the most universal, most instinctive reaction: “What can I do to help?” Everyone will be touched by caregiving at some point in life. What can each of us do now so that we are better prepared for our turn at bat? And how can we avoid burning out on the job?</p>

                        <p>During this introduction to the <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) model, you’ll hear the story of how the first STC group was born to help a divorced working mom with two teens and terminal cancer. And what happened to inspire the authors to write the STC guidebook so that others could follow in their footsteps.</p>

                        <p>The presentation includes examples of STC groups who have gone above and beyond the usual caregiving “call of duty” and their very inspiring accomplishments.</p>

                        <p>This presentation is about “workplace community” at its best.</p>

                        <p>Audience: perfect presentation for all employees, caregiver events and in-house support groups.</p>

                        <p>The audience learns through storytelling of how a “created STC families” have overcome some very difficult challenges. And though these families cannot cure, they can heal.</p>

                        <p>This presentations includes what it takes to start a STC group as well as important suggestions on how we can each “be better prepared” should we ever need support–no matter if we have family or not.</p>

                        <p>Audience: employees who live alone and especially those in treatment who have no family (nearby). For people who want to “be prepared” should they ever need the support of others.</p>

                        <p>If your corporate community has a number of employees who are caregivers and/or employees undergoing treatment and they are ready to accept a <span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span> (STC) group, but need guidance to get started, we offer a special workshop. Because the initial STC group meeting is designed to be organized and led by two committed friends, each employee will need to enlist them to attend.</p>

                        <p>Working together in little groups within a larger group, people can feel more encouraged and less alone in their need for outside support.</p>

                        <p>Following background stories and examples of what groups are capable of doing we walk everyone through each of the steps needed to organize and maintain their first STC meeting. Lots of Q & A and sharing.</p>

                        <p>If an employee undergoing treatment has no family (nearby) this is a wonderful way for two friends or co-workers to initiate a “caregiving family” to support them.</p>

                        <p>Following this workshop each person, within their small team, should leave with plan of action and a sense of confidence and enthusiasm about accepting help.</p>


                        <p>This workshop is between 3 – 3.5 hours There is minimum of 30 people.  It can be scheduled for weekend or after work hours.</p>

                        <p class="last"><span class="bold">Materials:</span> Each participant receives a copy of the STC guidebook and a special workbook that includes 23 STC forms, handouts and suggestions <span class="bold">(60-90 minutes)</span> Q & A, Handout brochures.</p>

                        <h2>New York City Partnership For Family Caregiver Corps Offerings</h2>

                        <h3 class="program-heading">Do you know how many of your employees are also family caregivers?</h3>
                        
                        <p>Statistics show that today, one in three people are the <span class="italic">unpaid</span> caregivers to a parent, spouse, partner, disabled child, sibling, or ill friend, qualifying them as family caregivers. Most often they are women in what we often call the “sandwich generation” – caring for an ailing parent as well as their own family.</p>

                        <p>And because of the burden of this additional role of caregiver, that lasts much longer than 9–5, they are more often less productive on the job as they would want to be due to the added stresses and inevitable depression.</p>
                        
                        <p>The <span class="italic">NYCP4FC Corps has aligned</span> six non-profit organizations to help corporate leaders learn more about the financial impact of family caregiving and to offer diverse ways to address this issue.</p>

                        <p>Originally sponsored by an existing “Care for the Family Caregiver” Initiative at EmblemHealth, the Partnership was launched to unite six generalists, already in the business of helping communities. The <span class="italic">NYCP4FC Corps</span> provides a full complement of services and information to address the many faces of family caregiving (not just the elderly) in a campaign of <span class="bold">Awareness</span>, <span class="bold">Acceptance</span> and <span class="bold">Action</span>.</p>

                        <p>Through programs, services, interventions, educational outreach and customized offerings, the <span class="italic">NYCP4FC Corps</span> seeks to help corporations improve their bottom line by helping their staff meet the challenges of both employee and caregiver roles with grace and dignity.</p>

                        <p>On Wednesday, March 25th EmblemHealth’s NYCP4FCC came together for a very productive event at TIME, Inc. <span class="bold">“Care For the Caregiver – Real Solutions for Tough Situations”</span></p>

                        <p>The large conference room was packed with over 50 working caregivers who joined us to learn about what the Corps had to offer. Instead of just having everyone just talk to Corps members one-on-one at their respective tables, Greg Johnson thought it would be much more productive to try a different format. As always, he graciously introduced the Corps panel members and gave us time to talk about our work and what we had to offer in the way of help. Then the room was opened up for Q & A.</p> 
                        
                        <img src="img/corporations-photos/CORPS-TEAM.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center3">
                        
                        <img src="img/corporations-photos/EMBLEMHEALTH-TABLE-SML.jpg" class="img-responsive img-right2">

                        <p >Working this way allowed for each question to answered by panel members with different points of view (which provided more options) and also allowed everyone present to have an opportunity to hear and learn something of great value that also concerned them.</p> 

                        <p class="last">Afterwards, many caregivers told us how glad they were to have taken their lunch time to attend. They realized that they shared many concerns with others in their workplace and the discussions made them feel that they were “not so alone” in their struggles.</p>

                        <blockquote>“I just learned about your group and your efforts today, after finally acknowledging to myself, my wife, and a friend or two this weekend that I am in danger of losing my job unless I confront the burnout I am experiencing and make some changes...</blockquote>

                        <blockquote> know that caregiving financial assistance in these days of economic turmoil is pretty nonexistent, so I am grateful to have found your site.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>“I usually manage to get an attitude of gratitude together to help get me through, but this week and the past few have found me with my head in the clouds, and those clouds have been very dark. I am glad to have found you and your site.”</blockquote>

                        <p class="strong">&nbsp;&nbsp;Email from a working caregiver</p>

                        <hr>
                        
                        <blockquote>“My Mom needed 24 hour care. I was overwhelmed. I have three small children. My husband works long hours. All of my family lives on the East Coast. I had felt so isolated and alone.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote> prayed to God to give me the strength to do it all, instead, he had my boss hold a (<span class="stc-name">Share The Care&#8482;</span>) meeting. When I walked into the room, I knew my prayers were answered, for he had sent me an ‘Army of Angels.’”</blockquote>
